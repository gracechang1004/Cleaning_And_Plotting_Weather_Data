# Cleaning_And_Plotting_Weather_Data
A Data Science Project


In this project, I examined the weather data of Ann Arbor, Michigan. The dataset came from a subset of The National Centers for Environmental Information Daily Global Historical Climatology Network. I used pandas and numpy to clean the dataset and then used matplotlib to write code that returned a line graph of the record high and record low temperatures by day of the year over the period 2005-2014. I shaded the area between the record high and record low temperatures for each day and overlaid a scatter of the 2015 data for any points for which the ten year record (2005-2014) record high or record low was broken in 2015. In the end, I removed leap days and made sure to consider issues like legends, labels and chart junk.
